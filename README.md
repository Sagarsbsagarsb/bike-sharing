Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

This project is about analyzing and predicting bike sharing demand using machine learning techniques. The dataset provides information about bike rentals across different hours and days, along with weather and seasonal conditions.

🔹 Objectives

Understand the patterns of bike rental demand.

Perform data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization.

Build a machine learning model to predict rental counts.

Evaluate performance using error metrics.

🔹 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy → Data analysis

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization

Scikit-learn → ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

🔹 Features

✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on bike rental trends
✔️ Handling missing values and feature engineering
✔️ Model training and testing with multiple algorithms
✔️ Performance comparison using RMSE and R² score
✔️ Graphical insights into rental patterns

🔹 Dataset

The dataset contains:

datetime → Date and time of rental

season → Season of the year

weather → Weather situation

temp, humidity, windspeed → Environmental factors

casual, registered, count → Bike rentals

🔹 Results

The trained models can predict daily/hourly rental demand with good accuracy.

Helps in understanding peak usage hours, seasonal demand, and weather impact.
